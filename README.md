# odin-recipes
My First Website!
Created a home page (index.html).
Also created one recipe called chicken alfredo.
The home page has a link that is refrenced to chickenalfredo.html.
chickalfredo.html has a picture that is refrenced from the internet.
It also has a header, an unordered list for the ingredients, and an order list for the cooking steps.
