        <li>2 Large Chicken Breast</li>
        <li>2 Cups Low Sodium Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>1 Pound Fettuccine</li>
        <li>2 Cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>4 Cloves Garlic, Very Finely Minced</li>
        <li>2 Large Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Chopped Italian Parsley</li>
        <li>2 Cups Grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper to Taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cooking Steps</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the 2 Large Chicken Breast and 2 Cups of Chicken Broth in a pot. Bring the pot to
            a simmer and then reduce the heat to low. Once the heat is low, keep the chicken simmering
            for a total of 10 minutes. After the 10 minutes take it off the heat and let it cool. Once 
            the chicken is done cooling slice the chicken to your desired size. </li>

        <li>Bring some water to a boil and add salt to the water. Once boiling add in the Fettuccini.
            Also while the pasta is cooking, take the Chicken Broth and reduce to about 1 Cup of liquid.
            After the Chicken Broth is reduced we are going to add the Minced Garlic, Black Pepper, and
            the 2 Cups of Heavy Cream. Bring the mixture to a low simmer and then turn off the heat.</li>
        
        <li>Next we are going to temper the 2 Egg Yolks. Take a small spoonfull of the hot cream mixture
            and mix it in with the Egg Yolks. Once that is incorporated, add in another spoonfull of that mixture.
            Do that about 3 to 4 more times and then you can wisk in the tempered Yolks into the sauce mixture. 
            Finally add Salt to taste.</li>
        
        <li>Once the Fettuccine is al dente, drain the water and toss the noodles back into that pot. Add in 
            the Chopped Parsley, 1 Cup of the Parmigiano-Reggiano, and all the cream mixture. Stur and let sit 
            for one minute. After one minute add in the rest of the cheese and all the Chicken.</li>
        
        <li>Plate, Garnish and Enjoy!</li>
